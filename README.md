### Mudae boostwish ($bw) optimizer

---
A small program to help calculate the optimal number of rolls to use for boost wish.

Formula used to calculate the spawn rate was taken from [svessinn's wish spawn rate calculator](https://svessinn.github.io/Mudae/WishSpawnrateCalc/) (formula is located at the bottom of the page).
